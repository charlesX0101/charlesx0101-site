<h1>&lt;/About&gt;</h1>

<p>I'm Charles, an IT Systems Specialist with more than ten years of experience in troubleshooting, managing endpoints, and providing hands-on support for macOS, iOS, Linux, and cloud-integrated environments.</p>

<p>After years in busy support roles, including retail IT and device repair, I started to focus on system architecture, cybersecurity, and automation. Now, I share my labs, tools, and learning publicly to stay sharp and accountable.</p>

<p>My workflow relies on the command line, shell scripting, and layered security practices. I think it's important to learn by doing. Building a professional identity comes from demonstrating your work.</p>

<p>I created this site to bring together my technical documentation, projects, and personal setup in one spot. Everything here shows actual builds, actual systems, and actual progress.</p>

<h2>[/Philosophy]</h2>

<p>I believe in simplicity, clarity, and practical use. I document everything I build, not because it's perfect, but because it's real. Every script here was created to solve a specific problem. If it helped me, maybe it will help someone else too.</p>

<h2>[/Other Interests]</h2>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy retro gaming, scripting for emulators, and working with digital audio. If it’s technical and worth doing by hand, it likely appears here.</p>
